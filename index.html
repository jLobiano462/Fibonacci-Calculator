        The Fibonacci numbers are a series of numbers that often occur in nature. This number sequence was
        developed in the middle ages, and it was named after Leonardo Pisano Bigollo, a famous mathematician who
        also happened to discover Fibonacci. Fibonacci is a short term for the latin filius bonacci, which means “the son
        of Bonacci.” In 1202, Leonardo Pisano Bigollo published his most prominent work the Liber Abaci (The Book
        of Calculating). In this book, he introduced his famous rabbit problem.
        If a pair of rabbits is put into walled enclosure (room) to breed, how many pairs of rabbits will there be
        after a year if it is assumed that every month each pair produces on new pair, which begins to bear young two
        months after its own birth?
        Solution:
        First, represent the adult pair of rabbits as A, and the baby pair of rabbits as B. For the fourth month, replace A
        by AB and B by A.
